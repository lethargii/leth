Hello. Today I'm going to talk about one song of Radiohead which is in my opinion one of the most engaged rock band. That song is called 2 + 2 = 5 and it is from their album "Hail to the Thief" released in 2003.

The message that is conveyed is people can believe anything even though it might be absurd and that it can be used to control a whole population. To do so, the lyrics depict a totalitarian regime where the population is controlled.

This is why the title is most likely to be a reference to George Orwell's 1984 in which Winston Smith, the main character, writes in his diary that "Freedom is the freedom to say that 2+2=4" while at the end of the novel, he is tortured until he believes and admits that 2 + 2 = 5.

The song has also an alternative title which is "The Lukewarm". It is another reference to Dante's Divine Comedy in which the lukewarm is someone who did nothing wrong but who did not oppose wrongdoing. So, the Lukewarm is the symbol of all the victims of the regime.

Before I start analysing the lyrics, we can observe that the song does not have a common form as it is not composed of verses and chorus but is divided into 4 different parts. We may think that this evolution is used to show the development of the story that is told in the song. 


Now, let's talk about the meaning of the lyrics. 
At the beginning, people live under oppression and are controlled without noticing it. They never question the common thought and they believe what they are told to believe: "2 and 2 always make up 5". People stay home because they feel safe.
Then, some of them slowly start to realize that they are not free. They may rebel against the government but nothing will happen. "There is no way out." They can't do anything for that.
After that, they realize that it is because they were not aware. In the third part of the song the expression "paying attention"is repeated many times. This is at that moment people understand that they are being brainwashed.
At the end, on the one hand, they know they are living in a totalitarian regime, that they are not free and on the other hand, they are conditioned not to believe the government's truth.


The instruments convey well the atmosphere of the song. The drum machine cause an idea of a perfect order (such as in a dictature), the guitare is oppressive and Thom York's voice is melancholic. This all makes the song very anxious.

I want to talk about the music video as well. In it people are represented as bulls and cows and the government is represented by pigs. This is clearly a metaphor. As the cows are milked again and again, people are cattle, working again and again for the benefit of the government. At first, the workers seem happy but later on we see that they are just slaves who believe everything that is said on TV and who only obey the government. When one of them is crucified, hanged or tortured they only stand and watch.

To conclude, the purpose of that song is to warn everyone, just like George Orwell did, that you must not trust everything you hear, that Freedom is fragile.

Thanks for listening and don't forget to pay attention.
