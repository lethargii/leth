Hello. When you are coaching a team it is necessary to have a method you will respect to obtain better results. Today, I'm going to present my method to train your players in the best way.

First I think you need to be authoritarian. When you coach athletes you do not have time to deal with people that don't agree with you. If they refuse to do what you say you might loose their trust and split them.

Then, you must understand each one of your players. This is because you need to adapt the way you are going to train them to make it more efficient. This will as well make your players trust you because you will develop a link between you and them.

You also should be phlegmatic as it is dangerous to make decisions when you are angry for example. You don't want to lose your nerves or get paniqued because it will only lead to stupid mistakes which are to be aborted.

One important thing though is to encourage your team. Your players may become way more confident with a good speech and it might make you min a game or even make your team play better than it was before.

Sometimes, you have to accept to withdraw. Otherwise, playing a game you are loosing in every single way may digust players. So even if it is a humiliation you might want to consider it to get a better approach later.

Finally, you need to question your method and change it when your team is losing. You must not apply the same rules in every situation as another state of mind may be more appropriate for other cases or may disturb your opponent.

Well, now I'm done. These are the rules I would follow to become the greatest coach. Thank you for listening. Bye.
