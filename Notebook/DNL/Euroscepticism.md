I'm going to talk about euroscepticism. It is, as a beginning, necessary to define what it is. Euroscepticism is the ideology that criticizes the European Union (this idea goes from having doubts of its utility to wanting the withdrawal from the European Union). Brexit is one obvious example of euroscepticism. We may ask ourselves : What are the arguments of the eurosceptics against the EU and is euroscepticism a spread or a spreading idea?




Firstly, the EU is said to have a lack of democracy since it is mostly run by people who are not elected and that the decisions they make are done without considering citizen's point of view. The eurosceptics believe all the european institutions (that is to say the European Commission, the European court of justice, etc) that they have too much power and that the sovereignty of the people is compromised. The European Union's supposedly unnecessary regulations and restrictions would also lead to higher costs and the way the economy is handled would only favor wealthy countries neglecting less developed ones. They argue that the EU's free movement policy has brought to uncontrolled immigration resulting in a pressure on public services, wages and social cohesion and that its policies of integration are undermining national identities and cultural diversity.

Secondly, we can see just by looking at the numbers that the EU's popularity is decreasing. The percentage of people thinking that the EU is a good thing has dropped from 45% in 2003 to 35% in 2015. In England, there are many eurosceptics. The result of the 2016 referendum which led to the Brexit was that 52% of the population were for leaving the EU while the other 48% weren't. Finally, there are a lot of political parties in Europe that promote euroscepticism. For instance, there is the National Front in France or the Five Stars Movement in Italy.





To conclude, euroscepticism is a growing ideology and it is probable that more and more people will start to reject the European Union. This phenomenon makes it possible to believe that the latter may disappear in the future.
