### Confession :
No ! It's not me, I swear it !... AAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAH. It was me from the beginning ! It was I who killed her. It was nothing personal. Miss Debasree was an excellent chemist. She was too good. Our researches were leading to unexpected results. Our mission would have stopped if it was to be known, so I changed the results. Unfortunately, Miss Debasree found out that there was something wrong. She didn't know it was me who did it. It wouldn't have taken long for her to discover who was behind it. That's why I decided to murder her.

As I said, I went to the terminal to send the daily report to Earth. By chance, Miss Debasree was up to keep up with her researches. I entered the chemistry room with my spacesuit. Miss Debasree didn't recognise me. That's when I cut out the air. If the corpse was to be discovered as is, it would have been obvious that she had run out of air. So I used the wrench to damage the body severely. I didn't expect that people would think Axel to be the murderer. Gaston was a perfect suspect, I knew everything about his "habits". I knew he would come in approximately 10 minutes after I killed Miss Debasree. As I expected, he changed the recordings. It was the perfect crime. Everyone would have decided that he was guilty if he didn't save the true recordings.
