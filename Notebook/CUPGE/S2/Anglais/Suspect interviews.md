Interviewing the people who are potentially involved in a case is essential
1- determine the alibi of the suspects and reduce the list of suspects thanks to alibis that can be proved easily. the rest may be guilty
2- when a suspect lies or hides something he acts differently. this is where science, psychology comes in. many ways to see if something is wrong with the suspect's story. something that doesn't make sense according to what other witnesses say or to what really happened. body language may change indicating the suspect is stressed (picking nose scratching hears) and they may talk differently. otherwise a lie detector may be used to check whether a person is lying or not by checking the suspect's pulse his brain activity etc...

Example :
There was a murder in a building at 10 o'clock.
There are 3 suspects A, B and C.
A claims that he left the building 9:30 and that B and C saw him.
B saw C leaving the building at 10 o'clock and A leaving at 11:30.
C says he left at 10 o'clock and he didn't see A or B leave the building.
A is lying.
