For our city of the future we have chosen to use 3 transports types : the subway, bicycles and vehicles. The Subway will be the most used transport type. It is one of the safest transport types and is theoretically the fastest way to get from one place to another for the reasons we'll talk about later on. Bicycles would be used when taking the subway is not necessary. Personal vehicles would be reserved for professional. Today, the fastest train is a train run by electromagnetism in a vacuum tube to prevent it from being slowed down by friction with the air. The entire subway would use the same system making the most efficient in the world. As for transports between the city and the rest of the country, a train station would be localized in the most accessible area for the outsiders. There would also be an airport situated in the North edge or the South edge of the city. Ultimately there would be a port at the West edge of the city.
