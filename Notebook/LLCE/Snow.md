I saw this morning stars that shined 8  
A million sparks above the ground 8  
- blind  
- round/found

I raised my head to see the sky 8  
It cast on me its softened light 8  
- And by/fly  
- There only was that gbright  

The wind then filled my lungs with air 8  
I felt the frozen heatness burn 8  
- my hair  
- turn  

I closed my eyes  
- snow  
I opened up my eyes  
- glow
